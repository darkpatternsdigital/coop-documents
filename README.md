# Coop documents repo

This repo is intended for documenting work-in-progress versioning of documents
necessary for the formation of a software development co-op.

This repository is for ideation and understanding of cooperative structure in an
organized fashion. As a result, they do not apply to any actual legal entity
that may appear to be referenced herein.

Documents themselves are kept at
[.\astro\src\content\documents](.\astro\src\content\documents), but that is not
their presented format; for that, an Astro server is used to render the files,
which may then be rendered to PDF via a web browser.

## Viewing documents

```sh
cd astro
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

Then, navigate to the local server that was created and view the document.
