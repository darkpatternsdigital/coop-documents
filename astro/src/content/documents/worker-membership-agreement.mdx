       Membership Unit in the Cooperative and rights acquired as a result of
       becoming a member in the Cooperative are not a security.  As such, no aspect
       of this Agreement or the transaction contemplated hereby have been reviewed,

           not be, registered under the Securities Act or under any state’s blue sky
           laws, because they do not constitute securities.

           Membership Unit is generally not subject to and is not being acquired for
           the purpose of realizing financial appreciation on the Membership Unit.

           support and gain access to certain non-pecuniary aspects of the business
           of the Cooperative.
        4. Member expressly acknowledges, understands, and appreciates that the
           Cooperative has no intention, and has in fact created certain
           disincentives to sell the Cooperative or substantially all of its assets
           for the financial gain of its members.
        5. The Member has sufficient experience in the business of the Cooperative,
           its financial condition and related investment risks sufficient to enable
           him/her/themself to be able to evaluate the risks involved in the
           transaction contemplated herein and to make an informed decision with
           respect to such transaction.
        6. The Member can afford a complete loss of the value of the Membership Unit
           being acquired hereby and is able to bear the economic risk of holding
           such Membership Unit for an indefinite period.

3. **TRANSFERABILITY**

    1. No Membership Unit may be transferred to any person or entity not otherwise
       qualified to be a Member in the Cooperative or that does not patronize the

       holding in co-tenancy, to a business entity controlled by such holder, to the
       Cooperative upon the redemption or acquisition thereof by the Cooperative, or

       transferee is not qualified to be a Member of the Cooperative, the
