       withdrawal.

   except according to procedures satisfying the requirements of this section:

       a vote pursuant to <VoteSection /> of the Members at a duly called
       meeting at which a quorum is present.
    2. The Member must be given fifteen (15) days’ prior notice of the
       expulsion, suspension, or termination, and the reasons for that
       expulsion, suspension, or termination.

       not less than five (5) days before the effective date of expulsion,
       suspension, or termination, by a person or body authorized by the Board
       of Directors to decide that the proposed expulsion, termination, or
       suspension not take place, and if no such person or body is authorized,
       then by the Board of Directors.
    4. Any notice required under this section may be given by any method
       reasonably calculated to provide actual notice. Any notice given by mail

       to refrain from conducting business as a Member until the expulsion
       decision is finalized. The Cooperative may also direct a Member whose
       expulsion is being considered to stay away from the Cooperative’s places
       of business except as necessary to exercise her or his rights under law.
    7. Notwithstanding the forgoing requirements for notice and a right to a
       hearing, a Member may be terminated immediately without notice or hearing

       against the Cooperative, including but not limited to fraud, theft, or
       embezzlement of the Cooperative’s property.

   property rights and interest in the Cooperative, as defined in this
   <MembershipPropertyRights />, which shall be equitably and conclusively
   appraised by the Board of Directors. The property rights and interest of a
   Member are defined to mean the amount paid by the Member for Membership Units
   acquired as a condition for Membership in the Cooperative.

   termination, the Cooperative shall pay to the Member the price paid by the
   Member for the Member’s Membership Unit.

   when such Member Account becomes payable to other Members in the Cooperative.

   the Member with respect to equity.

       thereof.

    6. Notwithstanding the above, any of the following decisions, other than by

       validly called and noticed, are valid if a quorum is present and each of
       the absent Members who is entitled to vote, either before or after the
       meeting, signs either: a written waiver of notice, a consent to the
       holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes of the meeting. All
       waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate
       records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
    2. Members present: A Member’s attendance at a meeting shall constitute a
       waiver of notice of and presence at the meeting, unless the Member
       objects at the beginning of the meeting. However, attendance at a meeting
       is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matter
       required to be included in the notice but not included, if an objection
       is made at the meeting.

    3. For fiscal years in which the Cooperative has (at any given time) over 25
       Members, the Cooperative shall notify each Member of his/her right to
       receive an annual financial report.
    4. The annual report shall be accompanied by any pertinent report by
       independent accountants.
    5. If there is no such report from an independent accountant, an authorized
       Officer of the Cooperative shall certify that the annual report was
       prepared from the books and records of the Cooperative, without audit.

## Disputes

1. All disputes, differences, and controversies arising from the performance of
   these Bylaws shall be resolved first through internal mediation within the
   Cooperative. In the event of a dispute between a Member and the Cooperative
   concerning any matter arising out of the relationship or transactions between
   the Member and the Cooperative, and that cannot be resolved through internal
   mediation, upon request of either party and after ten (10) days’ prior notice
   to the Member concerned, the matter shall be set for hearing before the Board
   of Directors, who shall hear the same, and shall enter written findings or
   rulings thereon. The decision of the Board of Directors in such cases shall
   be final; provided, however, that either party having received a decision may
   within sixty (60) days thereafter bring an appropriate action in any court of
   proper jurisdiction regarding such matter or transaction. Any Member affected
   by the final ruling rendered in the dispute, who shall thereafter refuse to
   acquiesce or abide by the ruling, shall thereafter be subject to termination
   of Membership in accordance with the provisions of <MembershipTermination />
   of these Bylaws.

## Indemnification

1. The Cooperative shall indemnify an individual that was made a party to a
   proceeding because the individual is or was a Director, officer, employee,
   agent, or other fiduciary of the Cooperative, against reasonable expenses
   incurred in the proceeding if
    1. the individual’s conduct was in good faith;
    2. the individual reasonably believed (i) in the case of conduct in an
       official capacity with the Cooperative, that the conduct was in the
       Cooperative’s best interests; and (ii) in all other cases, that the
       conduct was at least not opposed to the Cooperative’s best interests; and
    3. in the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual had no reasonable
       cause to believe their conduct was unlawful.

2. The Cooperative shall also indemnify any person who is serving or has served
   the Cooperative as Director, officer, employee, agent, or other fiduciary,
   and the estate and personal representative of any such person, to the extent
   and in the manner provided in any bylaw, resolution of the Board or the
   Members, contract, or otherwise, so long as such provision is legally
   permissible.

3. Notwithstanding Sections 12.1 and 12.2:
    1. the Cooperative shall not indemnify a Director, officer, employee, agent,
       or other fiduciary of the Cooperative in connection with a proceeding in
       which such individual was adjudged liable to the Cooperative or on the
       basis that such individual derived an improper personal benefit;
    2. indemnification in accordance with this Article VIII shall not extend to
       conduct that does not meet the requirements set forth in 9.1; and
    3. the Cooperative shall limit its indemnification of any party to the total
       assets of the Cooperative.

4. The cooperative may maintain liability insurance covering its directors,
   officers, employees and agents in connection with fulfilling its obligations
   under this section or otherwise.

## Amendments

1. Except for the matters set out C.R.S. 7-58-405 subsection (5) (including
   changes to the equity capital structure of the Cooperative, including the
   rights of Members to share in profits or distributions, or the relative
   rights, preferences, and restrictions granted to or imposed upon one or more
   districts, classes, or voting groups of similarly situated Members; the
   transferability of a Member’s interest; the manner or method of allocation of
   profits or losses among Members; the quorum for a meeting and the rights of
   voting and governance; or the terms for admission of new Members), the Board
   may make, amend, or repeal any provision of the Bylaws without Member
   approval, subject to a vote by the Directors in accordance with <VoteByDirectors />.
   If the Board amends the Bylaws in accordance with this <Amendments />, it shall
   provide a description of any such amendment to Members in a record not later
   than thirty (30) days after the amendment, but the description may be
   provided at the next annual members meeting if the meeting is held within the
   thirty-day period. Otherwise, these Bylaws may be altered or amended at any
   regular or special meeting of the Members by the affirmative vote of
   three-fourths (3/4) of the Members present or voting by mail provided the
   Members so voting have received the exact wording of the amendments.

## Distribution of Bylaws

After adoption of these Bylaws or an amendment to them, a copy of these Bylaws
or the amendment, as the case may be, shall be provided to each Member and to
each person who later becomes a Member as shown on the books of record of the
Cooperative.
