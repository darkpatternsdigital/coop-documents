    ready, able, and willing to pay the claim, and has paid or is paying
    generally claims arising under similar circumstances, but payment of the
    claim cannot be made for the reason that the cooperative does not know the
    whereabouts or mailing address of the one to whom it is payable or the one
    entitled to payment. If the claim is not actually paid within a period of
    three (3) years after notification as herein provided, the cooperative shall
    remove the claim as a liability on its books. No removal shall be made unless
    the cooperative shall have sent by first class, United States mail, a written
    notice of eligibility for payment addressed to the person appearing on the
    cooperative’s records to be entitled to payment at the last address of such
    person shown by the records of the cooperative. If not claimed within three
    (3) years after giving of notice, the claim shall be deemed extinguished. Any
    and all amounts recovered by the cooperative pursuant to this <UnclaimedMoney
    />, after deducting therefrom the amount of any taxes payable thereon, shall
