## Board of Directors

1. The corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the
   business and affairs of the Cooperative shall be managed under the direction
   of, the board of directors of the Cooperative (the “**Board**” or “**Board of
   Directors**”, and each a “**Director**”) which shall be elected in accordance
   with the Cooperative’s Bylaws.

2. With respect to any matter before the Board for a vote, consideration, or
   other action, each Director shall be entitled to consider the following
   factors, among any other factors such Director deems relevant, in connection
   with determining the best interests of the Cooperative and the Members with
   respect to such matter:

    1. the near-term, mid-term and long-term prospects and interests of the
       Cooperative and the Members;

    2. the social, economic, community, creative, legal and other effects the
       determination of such matter may have on those materially affected by the
       Cooperative’s conduct, including: (i) current and past Members; (ii) current and
       retired employees; (iii) customers, vendors, suppliers, subcontractors, independent
       contractors, strategic partners and joint venturers; and (iv) the communities in
       which the Cooperative operates;

    3. customary cooperative principles and values, applied in the context of each
       decision;

    4. the effect the determination of such matter may have on the environment and the
       economy of the communities in which the Cooperative operates; and

    5. whether the determination of such matter advances the Cooperative’s purpose, as
       defined in <Purpose /> above.

3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth in <BoardConsiderations />
   above is intended to or shall:

    1. create any additional fiduciary or other duties of any kind on the part
       of the Cooperative or any Director owed to the Members or any of the
       parties specified in <BoardConsiderations /> above;

    2. increase or expand the liabilities of the Cooperative or any Director or
       otherwise limit any defenses available to the Cooperative or any Director
       in connection with any claims, legal actions, lawsuits or other
       proceedings; and

    3. create any additional or special rights or causes of action in favor of
       the Members or any other third party, including without limitation, any
       of the third parties specified in this <BoardConsiderations /> above.

4. The Board shall have full power and authority to determine the terms and
   manner of issue, including, but not limited to, the consideration therefor,
   and to issue or cause the issue of all shares of capital stock of the
   Cooperative now or from time to time hereafter authorized. Each Director
   shall discharge their duties: (a) in good faith; (b) with care; and (c) in a
   manner that each Director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of
   the Cooperative.

5. Each Director or officer of the Cooperative shall in the performance of his
   or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon (i) the books
   of account of the Cooperative, (ii) reports made to the Cooperative by and of
   its officers or employees or by counsel, accountants, appraisers or other
   experts or consultants selected with reasonable care by the Directors or
   officers of the Cooperative, (iii) reports made by a committee of the Board
   of which the Director is not a member if the Director reasonably believes the
   committee merits confidence, or (iv) other records of the Cooperative. A
   Director may not rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements if the
   Director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes the
   reliance unwarranted.

6. A Director does not have any fiduciary duty to any creditor of the
   Cooperative arising only from the status as a creditor, whether the
   Cooperative is solvent or insolvent.

7. A Director does not have a conflict of interest solely because the
   Director's conduct relating to the duties of the Director may further the
   Director's own interest in their capacity as a member.

## Limitation on Director Liability

1. A Director shall not be personally liable to the Cooperative or to the
   Members for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director;
   except that this <LimitedLiability /> shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a
   Director to the Cooperative or to the Members for monetary damages for any
   actions taken, or for failure to take any action, as a Director otherwise
   existing for (a) an intentional infliction of harm on the Cooperative or the
   Members; (b) an unlawful distribution (that is, a distribution made which
   would cause the Cooperative to not be able to pay its debts as they become due
   in the usual course of business or a distribution made which would cause the
   Cooperative’s total assets to be less than the sum of its total liabilities);
   (c) any breach of the Director’s duty of loyalty to the Cooperative or to the
   Members; (d) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
   misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (e) acts specified in Section
   7-58-818 of the ULCAA; (f) acts specified in Section 7-108-403 of the Colorado
   Business Corporation Act; or (g) any transaction from which such Director
   directly or indirectly derived any improper personal benefit. It is the
   Cooperative’s intention to limit the liability of its Directors to the fullest
   extent permitted by applicable law. If the Colorado Business Corporation Act
   or the ULCAA is hereafter amended to eliminate or limit further the liability
   of a Director, then, in addition to the elimination and limitation of
   liability provided by the preceding sentences of this <LimitedLiability />, the
   liability of each Director shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest
   extent permitted by the Colorado Business Corporation Act or ULCAA so amended.
   Any repeal or modification of this <LimitedLiability /> shall not adversely affect any
   right or protection of a Director under this <LimitedLiability />, as in effect
   immediately prior to such repeal or modification, with respect to any
   liability that would have accrued, but for this <LimitedLiability />, prior to such
   repeal or modification.

## Indemnification

1. The Cooperative shall indemnify an individual that was made a party to a
proceeding because the individual is or was a Director, officer, employee,
agent, or other fiduciary of the Cooperative, against reasonable expenses
incurred in the proceeding if:

    1. the individual’s conduct was in good faith;
    2. the individual reasonably believed (i) in the case of conduct in an
       official capacity with the Cooperative, that the conduct was in the
       Cooperative’s best interests; and (ii) in all other cases, that the
       conduct was at least not opposed to the Cooperative’s best interests; and
    3. in the case of any criminal proceeding, the individual had no reasonable
       cause to believe their conduct was unlawful.

2. The Cooperative shall also indemnify any person who is serving or has served
   the Cooperative as Director, officer, employee, agent, or other fiduciary,
   and the estate and personal representative of any such person, to the extent
   and in the manner provided in any bylaw, resolution of the Board or the
   Members, contract, or otherwise, so long as such provision is legally
   permissible.

3. Notwithstanding Sections 9.1 and 9.2:
    1. the Cooperative shall not indemnify a Director, officer, employee, agent,
       or other fiduciary of the Cooperative in connection with a proceeding in
       which such individual was adjudged liable to the Cooperative or on the
       basis that such individual derived an improper personal benefit;
    2. indemnification in accordance with this <LimitedLiability /> shall not
       extend to conduct that does not meet the requirements set forth in 9.1;
       and
    3. the Cooperative shall limit its indemnification of any party to the total
       assets of the Cooperative.

## Amendment of Bylaws

1. Except for the matters set out C.R.S. 7-58-405 subsection (5), the Board may
   make, amend, or repeal any provision of the Bylaws without Member approval.
   If the Board amends the Bylaws in accordance with this <BylawsAmendment />,
   it shall provide a description of any such amendment to Members in a record
   not later than thirty (30) days after the amendment, but the description may
   be provided at the next annual members meeting if the meeting is held within
   the thirty-day period.

## Amendment of Articles of Organization

1. Following approval by two-thirds (2/3rds) of the Board, any amendment to
   these Articles shall be submitted to the Members for approval at any special
   or regular meeting of the Members, or by action without a meeting, duly
   authorized by the Bylaws. The Articles may be so altered or amended by at
   least a two-thirds (2/3rds) approval of the Members present at a duly
   authorized and convened Members’ meeting or by action without a meeting.

## Action by Members Without a Meeting

1. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a Members’ meeting, as set
   forth in the Bylaws, may be taken without a meeting if notice of the proposed
   action is given and the Members holding membership interests having not less
   than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
   the action at a meeting at which all of the membership interests entitled to
   vote thereon, as determined in the Bylaws, were present and voted, consent to
   the action in a record.
