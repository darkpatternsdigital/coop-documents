# Patronage

The concept of Patronage is common to cooperatives, but each one does it a bit
differently. Patronage is essentially the measure by which surplus generated by
a co-op is distributed back to its members. Patronage can be calculated many
ways:

- Number of dollars spent with a retailer cooperative, like REI
- Amount of products produced for a producer cooperative, like Ocean Spray
- Amount of services purchased, like in state-recognized healthcare co-ops
- Number of hours worked, such as in co-ops like ours

Patronage can be granted by a co-op for any number of activities that the co-op
wishes to encourage, but primarily it is granted for efforts contributed to the
coop.

## Patronage for Dark Patterns

As a technical consulting co-op, our patronage allocations will be more
complicated than "hours worked". As of this writing, the relevant definitions
include:

<div className="font-serif">

- "Tenure" shall be accumulated on a per-week basis, for all Members and
  Prospective Members within their candidacy periods, Sunday through Saturday,
  as the greatest of the following:

    * 1 if at least 1 hour was worked for the Cooperative, or if an employee
        of the Cooperative.
    * 2 if at least 8 hours were worked for the Cooperative.
    * 3 if at least 16 hours were worked for the Cooperative.
    * 4 if at least 24 hours were worked for the Cooperative.
    * 5 if at least 32 hours were worked for the Cooperative.

- "Patronage" shall be calculated per Member within a fiscal year as the sum of
  the following:

    * Tenure accumulated within the current fiscal year;
    * A number as determined via Patronage Schedules; plus
    * The lesser of (a) the Member's total Tenure at the end of the fiscal year
      or (b) twice the Patronage earned in the above.

- While no Patronage Schedule is in effect, the amount of determined via
  Patronage Schedules shall be calculated as 1 for every $5,000 paid to the
  Cooperative via executed contracts referred by the Member.

## Tenure

Tenure is designed to give a measure of how long someone has worked for the
cooperative while allowing a part-time worker to accumulate Tenure at a slower
pace than full-time workers.

- The work-week is defined for Tenure as Sunday through Saturday so that a
  member who works overtime during a weekend can more easily reach maximum
  Tenure during both the preceding and the following week. (This will also be
  helpful for workers who are moonlighting for the coop, as working both
  Saturday and Sunday in the same weekend will count as two separate weeks.)
- Any amount of work for the Cooperative earns 1 point of Tenure, even if it is
  only 1 hour.
    - Once we start employing people regularly, 1 point of Tenure will be
      accumulated even during a week of PTO.
    - Board meetings and correct accounting are very important for a successful
      business; Tenure should be accumulated for that time, too, even when not
      employed.
- Tenure reaches its maximum with 32 hours per week. This should encourage us to
  not continually work 40 hour weeks, but encourage more frequent long weekends.

## Patronage

Patronage is the number by which surplus (revenue generated by Members in excess
of expenses) is distributed to the Members. Patronage is frequently used by
coops as a way to encourage particular behaviors. As such, Patronage is defined
with a few key points:

1. Encourage the same concepts as Tenure; as workers, our time is the most
   valuable resource we bring to the coop.
2. Scale up over time. A new Member to the coop will not receive as much
   Patronage as a Member who has accumulated Tenure in previous years; this is
   to reflect onboarding time and to encourage a constant stream of growth. (See
   the examples for how this encourages growth.)
3. Show appreciation for contracts brought to the coop. Especially in our
   initial phase, new contracts will likely earn a commission; instead,
   additional Patronage is earned.

We have the ability to redefine the Patronage Schedule without an amendment to
the Bylaws so that we may add other non-labor incentives later. Some examples
that have already been discussed:

- Volunteer work
- Tutoring for college students in the fields in which we work
- Participating in local meet-up groups

### A note about Surplus

As a coop, just like in an LLC, tax reporting is the responsibility of the
individual Members. Surplus is distinct from Profits because federal tax law
says that only “patronage-sourced” income may be distributed as tax-deductible
patronage refunds/patronage dividends. As a result, money paid as patronage
dividends or advances on patronage dividends have a special tax class.
