# Patronage

The concept of Patronage is common to cooperatives, but each one does it a bit
differently. Patronage is essentially the measure by which surplus generated by
a co-op is distributed back to its members. Patronage can be calculated many
ways:

- Number of dollars spent with a retailer cooperative, like REI
- Amount of products produced for a producer cooperative, like Ocean Spray
- Amount of services purchased, like in state-recognized healthcare co-ops
- Number of hours worked, such as in co-ops like ours

Patronage can be granted by a co-op for any number of activities that the co-op
wishes to encourage, but primarily it is granted for efforts contributed to the
coop.

## Patronage for Dark Patterns

As a technical consulting co-op, our patronage allocations will be more
complicated than "hours worked". As of this writing, the relevant definitions
include:

- "Tenure" shall be accumulated on a per-week basis, for all Members and
  Prospective Members within their candidacy periods, Sunday through Saturday,
  as the greatest of the following:

    * 1 if at least 1 hour was worked for the Cooperative, or if an employee
        of the Cooperative.
    * 2 if at least 8 hours were worked for the Cooperative.
    * 3 if at least 16 hours were worked for the Cooperative.
    * 4 if at least 24 hours were worked for the Cooperative.
    * 5 if at least 32 hours were worked for the Cooperative.

- "Patronage" shall be calculated per Member within a fiscal year as the sum of
  the following:

    * Tenure accumulated within the current fiscal year;
    * A number as determined via Patronage Schedules; plus
    * The lesser of (a) the Member's total Tenure at the end of the fiscal year
      or (b) twice the Patronage earned in the above.
