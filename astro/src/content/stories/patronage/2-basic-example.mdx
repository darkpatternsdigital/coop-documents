import { PatronageRecord } from '../../../business-logic/patronage';
import { PointInTime } from '../../../components/patronage/point-in-time';

export const patronageExample = new PatronageRecord()
    .add('2024-04-29', 'addMember', { name: 'Alfred', tenureRatePerWeek: 5 })
    .add('2024-07-29', 'addMember', { name: 'Betty', tenureRatePerWeek: 5 })
    .add('2024-12-30', 'addMember', { name: 'Caitlin', tenureRatePerWeek: 5 })

As a simple example, let's consider the following events:

1. On Monday, April 29, 2024, Alfred starts the coop and he is all in, working a full-time
   40-hours every week. Every week, Alfred earns 5 tenure points.
2. On Monday, July 29, 2024, Betty joins Alfred, working a full-time 40 hours every
   week. Starting from then, both Alfred and Betty are earning 5 tenure points
   every week.
3. On Monday, December 30, 2024, Caitlin joins them both, also managing a full-time 40
   hours every week. Starting with the end of that week, all three of them are
   earning 5 tenure points every week.

Before Betty joined, it didn't matter how much Alfred earned; any surplus
distributed would be allocated entirely to him.

<PointInTime data={patronageExample.getDetailsAt('2024-07-27')} />

However, the week after Betty starts, Betty begins to accumulate patronage:

<PointInTime data={patronageExample.getDetailsAt('2024-08-03')} />

By the end of Q3, Betty has worked for 2 full months and Alfred has worked for
5, and the allocation of patronage reflects this split:

<PointInTime data={patronageExample.getDetailsAt('2024-09-30')} />

At the end of the year, Caitlin joins, but does not work a full week before the
end of year calculations are made.

<PointInTime data={patronageExample.getDetailsAt('2024-12-31')} />

Assuming no further team members are added, by the end of the following year,
even though all three worked full-time for the entire year, Alfred has slightly
more patronage due to having started earning tenure earlier.

<PointInTime data={patronageExample.getDetailsAt('2025-12-31')} />

However, by the end of the year after that, all the tenure has reached its
maximum contribution to patronage; as a result, the patronage shares have
stabilized with all three members earning an equal share.

<PointInTime data={patronageExample.getDetailsAt('2026-12-31')} />
